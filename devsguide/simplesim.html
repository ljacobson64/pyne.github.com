<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Referencing a card</dt>
<dd>Nowhere does a user ever need to specify a card number, which at sight has
little meaning, provides no insight to what it represents, and can make
modification a real pain. So, as is done in LaTeX, cards are given names
(labels), and when that card number is needed on another card, the user
references the other card by its name (or with the card object itself).
Now, the cards themselves live in the definition. The definition stores
cards in ordered dictionaries, and right now the card numbers are the
card&#8217;s index in the dictionary (+ 1 because of zero-indexing). That means
that at the time a card is written, it needs access to access the
simulation, which knows the card numbers. Therefore, the
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">cards.ICard.mcnp()</span></tt> method takes in the simulation.
These methods are called by the input file object, which has the
simulation.</dd>

<li>Make sure that the base class constructor is called using <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">super()</span></tt>.

<li>Be sure to give complete docstrings for at least the class and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></tt>.

<li>Each card has a <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">comment()</span></tt> and <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">mcnp()</span></tt> method. The comment
should be defined for each card, but the mcnp card only needs to be defined
for cards that MCNP supports. To support a different code, i.e. Serpent,
define a <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">serpent()</span></tt> method.</li>

<dt>MCNP</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The most important thing to the initial developer was to have something that
worked for MCNP, given his limited development time. Therefore, the content
of the cards is very similar to that which is found in MCNP. Ideally, the
cards would be created independently from a specific code. However, doing so
would likely lead to making sacrifices for all codes, including MCNP. The
way the code is written now, it surely works well for MCNP, though
sacrifices may need to be made for other codes.</p>
<p class="last">The following paragraph was written before development of the module:
<cite>Perhaps it is ideal to create some very general definition that could be
used for any code, but I think that is a little ambitious and idealistic,
and will ultimately result in sloppy attempts to match the general
definition to specific codes or will hamper the functionality of the general
definition. Thus, I think MCNP should be the &#8220;first child&#8221;/&#8221;first class
citizen&#8221; (incorrect usage) of this package.  Classes can be written in</cite>
<a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_inputfile.html#module-pyne.simplesim.inputfile" title="pyne.simplesim.inputfile"><tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyne.simplesim.inputfile</span></tt></a> <cite>allowing the system and option
definitions to be used to generate input files for other codes, but will
require special consideration. Two cases to consider are that densities and
reflecting boundary conditions are specified in different places between
MCNP and Serpent. The code will be written so that these settings are placed
in the proper place for the MCNP input, and the Serpent inputfile class will
have to pick that information from its place in the MCNP cards and place it
in the right place for a Serpent input. The Serpent inputfile class will
likely need to contain many exceptions for inputs to MCNP that Serpent
cannot handle (e.g.  importances on cell cards). MCNP is a widely used code,
and a product taht can cleanly generate MCNP input but that cannot generate
input to other codes as well is more valuable, I think, than a product that
falls short for all codes (including MCNP).</cite></p>
</dd>
<dt><tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">cards.ICard.mcnp()</span></tt></dt>
<dd>It was initially advised that the MCNP card functionality would be separated
from the card classes. It seemed preferable to place all code-specific
functionality in one class (i.e.
<a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_inputfile.html#pyne.simplesim.inputfile.MCNPInput" title="pyne.simplesim.inputfile.MCNPInput"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">inputfile.MCNPInput</span></tt></a> for MCNP). Given time
constraints, it was not possible to do this.  Furthermore, it seems that the
structure as it is now, where each card has a <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">mcnp()</span></tt> method, makes
a lot of sense: it allows us to take advantange of inheritance and similar
structure between cards in the same category.</dd>
<dt>Separation of <a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_definition.html#pyne.simplesim.definition.SimulationDefinition" title="pyne.simplesim.definition.SimulationDefinition"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">definition.SimulationDefinition</span></tt></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_inputfile.html#pyne.simplesim.inputfile.IInputFile" title="pyne.simplesim.inputfile.IInputFile"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">inputfile.IInputFile</span></tt></a></dt>
<dd>At first glance it may not make sense to separate the defintion from the
input file object.
Since <a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_definition.html#pyne.simplesim.definition.SimulationDefinition" title="pyne.simplesim.definition.SimulationDefinition"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">definition.SimulationDefinition</span></tt></a> is
subclassed to create <a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_definition.html#pyne.simplesim.definition.MCNPSimulation" title="pyne.simplesim.definition.MCNPSimulation"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">definition.MCNPSimulation</span></tt></a>,
there is MCNP-related information in more than one place, and it may seem
that all the code-specific information could be contained in one class.
However, there should be code-independent simulation definition parameters
that belong in <cite>definition.SimulationDefintion</cite>. It is
possible that it becomes clear that the input file task can be roped into
the simulation definition, but the additional modularization should be easy
to &#8216;undo&#8217;. Also, it was thought that the input file classes would eventually
have the ability to parse in an input file, and so it might make sense to
have a separate class.</dd>
<dt>Referencing other cards using strings or the objects themselves</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Many cards need information about other cards. For example, tallies need to
know the card number of the surfaces or cells being tallied. There are at
least two ways to provide this information to the tally card: give the
actual card object, or just give the string name of the card to be tallied.
In both cases, the card looks up the surface or cell number in the system
defintion, using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sim</span></tt> input of the <tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">mcnp()</span></tt> method. Right
now, the cell card takes in the actual cards, not just card names, but all
simulation-related cards take in card names, not hte actual cards. The
reason for using card names only is that it makes it easier for the user to
modify an input they&#8217;ve already created, after the user no longer has the
original cards they created. Rather than doing something like
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Tally(sys.cells['cA'])</span></tt> to create a tally, the user can just do
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Tally('cA')</span></tt>.</p>
<p>This further has the advantage that the user can define
the tally before the cell &#8216;cA&#8217; is even created, putting less restrictions
on how the user defines the system. The disadvantage here is that passing
the actual object allows for type checking, and puts less restriction on
the names used for cards. For example, some cards accept either a cell or
universe. If providing a name only, then the code does not know whether the
string is the name of a cell or universe. If providing the objects
themselves, the object contains the knowledge of its type.</p>
<p class="last">This issue has been managed for tallies by creating the
<a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_nestedgeom.html#module-pyne.simplesim.nestedgeom" title="pyne.simplesim.nestedgeom"><tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyne.simplesim.nestedgeom</span></tt></a> module. In this module, there are
classes such as <a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_nestedgeom.html#pyne.simplesim.nestedgeom.Cell" title="pyne.simplesim.nestedgeom.Cell"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">nestedgeom.Cell</span></tt></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_nestedgeom.html#pyne.simplesim.nestedgeom.Surf" title="pyne.simplesim.nestedgeom.Surf"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">nestedgeom.Surf</span></tt></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_nestedgeom.html#pyne.simplesim.nestedgeom.Univ" title="pyne.simplesim.nestedgeom.Univ"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">nestedgeom.Univ</span></tt></a> that only hold a string name of
a cell/surface/universe (they are not cells/surfaces/universes themselves),
but make it clear thta the string name represents a cell/surface/universe.
The problem here is that the notation becomes quite verbose.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Float formatting</dt>
<dd>The author did not want to presume how detailed the user wanted to be about
the floats that appear in the input file. Therefore, the user can set the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">float_format</span></tt> in the input file. The syntax used for specifying the
float format is what is typically found in C++ and MATLAB (i.e. &#8216;%.5g&#8217;).
Python now expects users to use their own syntax (i.e. &#8216;{:.5g}&#8217;. Here, the
former has been used to make it easier for people who are new to Python to
use this package. This does cause code to be more verbose, as for
everything except these floats, string formatting is done with
<tt class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">str.format()</span></tt>.  It is possible that there are different categories
of floats, and that the user would want each of these types of floats to be
formatted differently.  This is not supported currently.</dd>
<dt>Default arguments</dt>
<dd>Since codes like MCNP have default arguments themselves when arguments are
left out, those arguments are left out the cards in this package. That is,
the default values that a particular code uses are not stored in the
package, as the defaults may change or may be different across different
codes. Instead, default arguments are set to None, which usually means to
omit that input from the input file. This may not be true for all cards.</dd>

<div class="section" id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Saving and loading definitions</dt>
<dd>This is the biggest limitation, that definitions and cards cannot be saved
in a persistent manner. Work has been done on this front, however. A
subclass of the JSONEncoder can be found in
<a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_definition.html#module-pyne.simplesim.definition" title="pyne.simplesim.definition"><tt class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyne.simplesim.definition</span></tt></a>. A crude way to allow for this saving
and loading would be to define a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__repr__</span></tt> method for all cards.</dd>
<dt>Surfaces</dt>
<dd>Only a few surfaces are implemented right now; there needs to be many more.</dd>
<dt>MCNP card order</dt>
<dd>In MCNP, data cards that refer to cell cards by the order of cell cards
(i.e.  Volume) actually depend on the order in which the cell cards are
listed, and not at all on the cell card numbers. In the current
implementation, cells (well, all cards) are always printed in order of
increasing card number, so this is not an issue. However, if the user
supplies custom cards with card numbers out of order, then this would
present an issue.</dd>
<dt>Card numbers</dt>
<dd>It is assumed for the most part in the definitions that cards are numbered
as they are in MCNP. This is fine for the simulations, since those are
expected to be subclassed for a specific code. However, the system supposed
to be completely code-independent.</dd>
<dt>MCNP Macrobody facets</dt>
<dd>In MCNP, the user is able to specify a facet of a macrobody surface on a
cell card (i.e. 3.2 is facet 2 of surface 3). Preliminary work has been done
to implement this, but this is not functional.</dd>

</div>
<div class="section" id="further-development">
<h2>Further Development<a class="headerlink" href="#further-development" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Initial discussions about this package set forth a much larger task: creating
an abstract syntax that  is truly abstracted from a specific code (i.e.
MCNP). This is certainly possible for the cards associated with the system
definition, but doing so with the simulation definition seems very difficult
and likely not possible.</li>
<li>An additional module, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">run</span></tt>, may provide the
much-desired functionality of executing the correct program (MCNP, etc.) and
connecting the run to the appropriate input parsers provided in other modules
of <cite>PyNE</cite>. Furthermore, such a module could contain a method to perform a
parameter study simply with one method call (something like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">keff_vector</span> <span class="pre">=</span>
<span class="pre">run.parameter_study(param_name,</span> <span class="pre">param_values</span></tt>).</li>
<li>Universes, lattices, and fill are done either using IMisc cards or on the
<a class="reference internal" href="../libref/simplesim_cards.html#pyne.simplesim.cards.Cell" title="pyne.simplesim.cards.Cell"><tt class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">cards.Cell</span></tt></a> card. However, it is preferable that
there are actual Universe and Lattice cards/objects (this is not the same
thing as the current Universes and Lattice cards, that are just an
implementation of MCNP&#8217;s U and LAT cards) that can be used to fill cells
instead of regions.</li>
<li>Geometry transformations. Right now, a crude form of geometry transformations
are allowed; the user can shift and stretch surfaces or regions, so long as
the surface supports it. Rotation is not yet supported. The surfaces are
still tied to how they are defined in MCNP, and so for most surfaces rotation
is not supported.</li>
<li>Serpent provides a few macros, like the pin macro, that makes the
specification of surfaces and cells a lot easier. These can be implemented
here using static Region methods that create a region, and the required
surfaces.</li>
<li>It would be nice, for MCNP materials, if this package could automatically
pick the correct nuclide library table identifiers for a given temperature
(e.g. .71c for 600 K), though this would change over time. A manual override
should also be allowed.</li>
<li>MCNP cards are mostly printed in a sloppy way (except material cards); it
would be nice to exploit the automated card string generation in order to
have the strings print in a pretty way.</li>
<li><strong>TODO</strong> nodes for small items can be found scattered among the code.</li>
